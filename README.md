# Datawarehouse-for-geographical-animal-sighttings
Geographical occurrences and biodiversity data on carnivore mammals in Spain.

Project for Data warehousing & business intelligence: 

The objective was to gather data from different sources in order to build a MVP of Data warehouse that would synthesize data on animal occurrences across Spain, along with climatic data and animal traits data. This tool would facilitate hypothetical future analysis tasks on this matter.
